# Piscine README

Welcome to the piscine! There's a lot to take in the first couple of days, so here are a few handy links.

## Tools

[Intra](https://intra.42.fr) - Go here to start your projects.

[Slack](https://berlinpiscinejune2022.slack.com) - Important communication will take place here.

[Notion](https://www.notion.so/42wolfsburgberlin/temp-The-42-Berlin-Metaverse-80f153d687204f6fa07bea9ade2b6fa8) - Our FAQ with bells and whistles.

If you have not received an invitation to Slack or Notion, please mail pedago@42berlin.de with your login.

## Don't panic

If you feel lost, don't panic. Ask the peer to your right. And if they don't know, ask the peer to your left.
